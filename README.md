# feetech-servo-tool

Python port of FT_SCServo_Debug_Qt, with the goal of being cross-platform.

# status of development

The tool is actually only compatible with Feetech ST series (and possibly SC)
which is what I have to test.

All functionality works. Missing is the ability to save and load configurations
from file.

And the code is still pretty "unpolished". A lot of clean up is needed.
