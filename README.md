# feetech-servo-tool
Python port of FT_SCServo_Debug_Qt, with the goal of being cross-platform.

# status of development

Basic funcionality works. You can connect to the servo, read and write values
from the memory map, and perform Step and Sweep tests.

Advanced functions like sync writing are still missing.

And the code is still pretty "unpolished". A lot of clean up is needed.
