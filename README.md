# feetech-servo-tool

Python port of FT_SCServo_Debug_Qt, with the goal of being cross-platform.

# status of development

The tool is actually only compatible with Feetech ST series (and possibly SC)
which is what I have to test.

All functionality works. Missing is the ability to save and load configurations
from file.

And the code is still pretty "unpolished". A lot of clean up is needed.

The current release is v0.1.0, which you can download as a binary for MacOS (Intel), 
Windows and Debian/Ubuntu [here](https://github.com/dgmz/feetech-servo-tool/releases/tag/v0.1.0). Other Debian based distros may work too. If it doesn't
try with the source code. Sorry for Apple hardware Macs, but I don't own one, so
no binary for now.
